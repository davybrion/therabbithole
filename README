NOTE: be sure to run 'npm install' within the project folder to get all of the required dependencies

This project is meant to be a technical playground/breakable toy where i get to play 
with all kinds of interesting technologies. The initial goal of the project 
(not counting the learning opportunities) is to be able to generate invoices and 
timesheets for a selected task/project for a customer. The invoices and timesheets
need to be generated as PDF's.

Technologies that will be used:
- Node.JS
- Express.JS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- jQuery
- Backbone.JS
- QUnit
- jasmine-node

I'm currently still reading up on Node.JS and MongoDB so it might take a week or two 
before actual code shows up in this repo :)
