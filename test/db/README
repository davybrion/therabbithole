A lot of the tests in this folder are exploratory in nature, so they don't really
have any added value outside of getting familiar with MongoDB and Mongoose. There
are however some tests that check validation of required fields, default values, 
helper methods regarding embedded documents/objects so it does make sense to have
tests for those.
